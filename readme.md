File: `word-frequency-data.txt`
-------------------------------

The `word-frequency-data.txt` file is used to store and transfer data for the Word Frequency List Manager. It contains JSON-formatted data with the following structure:



````
{
  "words": "1 the a\\n2 be v\\n3 and c\\n4 of i\\n5 a a\\n...",
  "chatgptResults": "the. The is a word we use to refer to something specific...",
  "favorites": \["the", "be", "and"\]
}
````
### Fields:

*   **`words`**: A string containing the word frequency list. Each line represents a word with its weight, word, and type.
    
*   **`chatgptResults`**: A string containing definitions and examples for the words, generated by ChatGPT.
    
*   **`favorites`**: An array of words that have been marked as favorites by the user.
    

### Example `word-frequency-data.txt` File:
